		 * To Mr Rudowski:
		 * I hope you enjoy the code. I have worked extensively with audio
		 * analysis and production with my music production hobby. As for my coding experience,
		 * I have been coding for 7 years and I work as the IT Director for Focused Coaching. I have written much
		 * better tools, algorithms and VSTs but unfortunately I no longer retain the rights to
		 * the code. And quite frankly, I don't want to risk getting sued AGAIN over this code.
		 * You are going to have tp deal with this absolutely beautiful swing GUI and simple analysis tools that I know
		 * the people stalking my github wont flip their shit over. Please feel free to contact me with any questions
		 * about my code at my school email 120nschnitzer@frhsd.com
